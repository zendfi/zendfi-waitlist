This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Additional packages installed ✅

- `framer-motion` — for animations
- `react-icons` — icon components
- `shadcn` UI — initialized with `npx shadcn@latest init` and a sample `Button` component added
- `three` — for 3D graphics and rendering
- `next-themes` — theme management and dark/light switching (provider enabled)

## Theme support

The app is configured to use class-based dark mode via Tailwind (`darkMode: 'class'`) and `next-themes` is enabled. A small `ThemeToggle` is available at the top of the sample `Hero` component to switch between light and dark themes.

## Local development

- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (if port 3000 is busy Next will use a free port, e.g., 3001)

## Example files

- `app/components/Hero.tsx` — sample component demonstrating `framer-motion`, `react-icons`, and the `Button` from `components/ui/button.tsx`
